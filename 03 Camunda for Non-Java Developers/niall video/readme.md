Remember another type of task navigating to *BPMN 2.0 Poster* (http://www.bpmb.de/images/BPMN2_0_Poster_ES.pdf). We will implement the a number of symbols __Topics__: Implementation of service tasks interacting with a service __Goals__: Implement common a easy service tasks interacting with a service.

|__6__|__Model in Camunda Modeler__| 3. __(4'38'')__ For the user task *prepare roman legions for battle* in 'Forms --> Form Field' the variable `numberOfTribes` 'Type = long', 'Label = How many tribes are there', and 'Default Value = 10'. <br> 4. __(5'39'')__ For the 'Conditional Event' 'legion is defeated', go to 'General --> Details --> Condition' writ '#{legionStatus == 'defeated'}' <br> 5. __(5'53'')__ The task *fight against germanic tribe* for 'General --> Loop Cardinality' and write `#{numberOfTribes}` and in 'Details --> Implementation --> External' and in 'Topic' write 'FightTribe' <br> For the model go to 'General --> Id' with 'RomanLegions' and 'General --> Name' with 'Roman Legions' <br> 6. __(8'12'')__ Save the model
|__7__|__Deploy in Camunda__| 7. __(8'30'')__ Deploy in Camunda Cokpit with the Enterprise Edition <br> 8. __(9'55'')__ For the service task 'fight against germaninc' tribe' observe that we need the 'Topic' named 'FightTribe' <br> 9. __(10'15'')__ Next, go to *docs.camunda.org* 'Reference --> Rest API --> External Task --> Fetch and Lock --> Example' and explain the 'Request Body' <br> 10. __(11'49'')__ The go to 'Complete' and to the example <br> 11. __(12'15'')__  The go to the 'nikku/camunda-worker-node' (https://github.com/nikku/camunda-worker-node). There you will find an external task workers for Camunda BPM in NodeJS. <br> 12. __(12'33'')__ Explain what the app is doing, specially in the 'index.js' with the 'http://localhost:8080/engine-rest'. Observe the variable names 'FightTribe' and 'legionStatus'. <br> 13. __(13'13'')__ Compile and run the application with `node .\index.js`. <br> 14. __(13'31'')__ Run the Cockpit and start the process. In the task 'Prepare Roma Legions for Battle' change 'how many legions for battle' from $10$ to $20$. <br> 15. __(15')__ In the cockpit we can see the number of instances are running |40|
