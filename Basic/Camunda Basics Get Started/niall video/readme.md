|__2__|__Presentation__|Good morning (afternoon)! My name is Sigifredo Laengle. I am professor at this Faculty. We will study in this last part of the course BP Automation an we will use the open source software Camunda. In this class I will present the topics, the objectives, and the evaluation procedure. It must be clear all of these aspects of the course."|5|
|__3__|__Topics, goals, and evaluations__| We are studying in the phase Process to Applications (P2A) of BPM. The objective of this phase is to implement a process (a *to-be process model*) in the technology infrastructure. Typically is a phase of automation. __Topics__: We will try to implement in Camunda an important part of BPMN 2.0. __Goals__: At the end of the course, the student will be able to implement simple cases of an important part of BPMN 2.0 with Camunda. We will try to think in a non-Java process business-engineer. __Evaluations__: We will have 4 evaluations (2 individual and 2 in group). |10|
|__4__|__Camunda Basics Get Started__|1. Go to the first video “Camunda Basics Get Started” (17’) and answer typical questions. <br> 2. __(40'')__ We are reviewing each component. Each component corresponds to an application: Modeler, Task List, Cockpit, and Admin. The apps Task List, Cockpit, and Admin interact with the Engine through REST (Representational state transfer). <br>3. __(1’40’’)__ Go to google and look for ‘camunda’, select  www.camunda.com, then press ‘download’ (60MB). Uncompress the file in folder ‘Applications’ (remember the file!). Then search in Google ‘java jdk download’ (200MB) and download the corresponding distribution. <br> 4. __(4’09’’)__ In ‘camunda-tomcat’ go to the folder ‘server’ (this is important, because we will work with it. Double click in ‘start-camunda.bat’. <br> 5. __(4’32’)__ Go to http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index. There we have the components. <br> 6. __(5'10'')__ We will start with ‘cockpit’. The user is demo/demo. First is ‘process/process definition’. We cannot do ‘migrations’ with the community edition. <br> 7. __(12’25’’)__ Go to https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.8/installation/camunda-modeler/ and download *Camunda Modeler*. Unzip in the same folder as before, i.e. ‘Applications’. Run the modeler and create the model ‘write something.bpmn’. They to deploy it as in the video and you will not do it, because the community version. <br> 8. __(15’22’’)__ We will continue with ‘task list’. The user demo/demo, the go to every option. <br> 9. Finally, after the video, download the Go to google and look for ‘camunda’, select  www.camunda.com, then press ‘download’ (60MB). Uncompress the file in folder ‘Applications’ (remember the file!). Then search in Google ‘java jdk download’ (200MB) and verify the corresponding distribution. In ‘camunda-tomcat’ go to the folder ‘server’ (this is important, because we will work with it. Double click in ‘start-camunda.bat’. |20|
|__5__|__Revision `admin`__|1. Review `admin`. We have 4 users: Demo Demo, John Doe, Mary Anne, and Peter Meter. <br> 2. Then review `groups`: Accounting, camunda BPM administrators, Management, and Sales. <br> 3. Review relationships between Users and Groups: accounting — mary, demo; management — peter, demo; sales — john; camunda-admin — demo. <br> 4.

Go to 'More --> Deployments' and look for instances, for example *camunda-invoice*. Select an instance and review the tables discovering *invoiceClassification* and *(result)*. <br> 3. Then download the models *invoicev3.bpmn* and *review-invoice.cmmn*.|10|
|__7__|__Revision `task list`__|1. In the modeler, select *Invoice Recieved*, then 'Forms --> Form Key' <br> 2.
