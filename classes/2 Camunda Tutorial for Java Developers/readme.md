|__1__|__Preparation__|	1. Go to the link: [videos](https://camunda.com/learn/videos/). <br> 2. Be sure that speakers work! 	|5|
|__2__|__Presentation__|We will continue with *Camunda Tutorial for Java Developers* by implementing a Service Task in Java Script. |5|
|__3__|__Topics, goals, and evaluations__| We are studying in the phase Process to Applications (P2A) of BPM. This is a very common task to implement a Java Script for a Service Task. Remember another type of task navigating to *BPMN 2.0 Poster* (http://www.bpmb.de/images/BPMN2_0_Poster_ES.pdf). We will implement the a number of symbols __Topics__: Implementation of service tasks with Java Script __Goals__: Implement common a easy service tasks with JavaScript.
|__4__|__Camunda Tutorial for Java Developers__|1. Go to the second video “Camunda Tutorial for Java Developers” (21’) and answer typical questions.  <br> 2. __(1'33'')__ Go to 'eclipse download' and download Eclipse OXIGEN and install it. Then, go to 'camunda docs -- user guide -- process applications'. Copy archetype catalog in Eclipse. Add archetype catalog (Preferences -> Maven -> Archetypes -> Add Remote Catalog): https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/repositories/camunda-bpm/ . Then, create Maven project from archetype: (File -> New -> Project -> Maven -> Maven Project) <br> 3. __(2’52’’)__ In Eclipse go to 'New --> Project --> Maven Project' and select 'Maven --> camunda-archetype-servlet-war'. In Group Id: 'com-camunda.demo' in ArtifactId: 'SimpleDemo' <br> 4. __(5'6’’)__ Edit *process.bpmn* and *pom.xml* <br> 5. __(6’10’)__ Again to the *process.xml* and add a *service task* with the name *check weather* 
|__5__|__Model__|![model](https://github.com/sigifredolaengle/camunda-classes/blob/master/classes/2%20Camunda%20Tutorial%20for%20Java%20Developers/weatherOk.png)||| 
|__6__|__Camunda Tutorial for Java Developers__| 6. __(7'59'')__ Create a new java class in `src/main/java` and paste it Implementation `Java Class` with the name *CheckWeatherDelegate*. Add interfaces: `JavaDelegate`, the OK and Finish. Write in the Java Class: 
|__7__|__Java Class__|`Random rando = new Random();` <br> `execution.setVariable("name", "Sijo");`<br>`execution.setVariable("weatherOk", rando.nextBoolean());`<br>Copy the the Java Class (not the program!)`qualified name`  *com.camunda.demo.SimpleDemo.CheckWeatherDelegate*. <br> 7. __(11'59'')__ Then fill out each path with the `Condition Type` as `Expression` with `#{weatherOk}` and `#{not weatherOk}` respectively. <br> 8. __(12'55'')__ Next, create the `LoggerDelegate.java` and assign the class `LoggerDelegate` (copy qualified name) `com.camunda.demo.SimpleDemo.LoggerDelegate` into the `Service Task` `print complaint about weather` in `Implementation` as Java Class. Finally, add three `User Tasks` with the `Form Field` named `weatherOk`. <br> 9. __(12'28'')__ Build the `process application` with *rogth click* and 'Run as --> Maven Install'. Then copy the `.war` file in  `/Applications/camunda-bpm-tomcat-7.8.0/server/apache-tomcat-8.0.47/webapps` <br> 10. __(15')__  If you have problem with Java, follow the video by selecting `jdk1.8`. <br> 11. __(16'48'')__ Start `camunda-tomcat` <br> 12. __(18'10'')__ Run the process in `task list`. The video is different, because it review the *history*, wich belongs to the *Enterprise edition*. |40|
